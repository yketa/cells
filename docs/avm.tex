\section{Mesh}

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75*\scale]
\input{src/schematic}

\caption{Schematic of a cell (highlighted in pink) in the vertex model.}
\label{fig:schematic}
\end{figure}

A \textit{cell centre} is enclosed by \textit{cell corners} (or \textit{vertices}). These are linked between themselves by \textit{junctions}. We will assume (i) that cells are always convex so that the mesh remains planar, and (ii) that no edge joins two cell centres. The ensemble of the vertices and the edges that link them constitutes the \textit{geometric mesh}. The specification of the cell centres and the junctions between non-cell-centres defines the \textit{physical mesh}.

\section{Cell potential energy}

We introduce for each cell $i$ a reference perimeter $P^0_i$ and a reference area $A^0_i$, and for each of its cell corner $\mu \in \Omega_i$ a force whose effect is to bring the cell's perimeter $P_i$ and area $A_i$ to their reference quantities. A possible force derives from the following potential energy \cite{farhadifar2007influence,fletcher2014vertex,bi2016motilitydriven,sknepnek2023generating}
\begin{equation}
E_{\mathrm{VM}} = \sum_{\text{cells } i} \left[\frac{1}{2} K_i (A_i - A_i^0)^2 + \frac{1}{2} \Gamma_i (P_i - P_i^0)^2\right],
\label{eq:evm}
\end{equation}
where $K_i$ and $\Gamma_i$ are respectively area and perimeter elastic constants. We denote $\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu}$, $\boldsymbol{r}_i$ the position of vertices $\mu, i$. The cell's perimeter can be written
\begin{equation}
P_i = \sum_{\mu \in \Omega_i} |\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}|,
\end{equation}
and the cell's area can be computed with the shoelace formula
\begin{equation}
A_i = \sum_{\mu \in \Omega_i} \frac{1}{2} [(\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{i}) \times (\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_{i})] \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z.
\end{equation}
Note that, by convention of ordering of cell corners, each term in this sum \textit{must be} positive. With these notations, we thus write the force acting on vertex $\mu$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{F}_{\mathrm{VM},\mu} = -\nabla_{\mu} E_{\mathrm{VM}},
\label{eq:fmugrade}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_{\mu} \equiv \partial/\partial \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu}$. We compute
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mu} \left(|\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}|\right) = \frac{\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}}{|\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}|},
\end{equation}
as well as
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mu} \left([(\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_i) \times (\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_i)] \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z\right) = (\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_i) \times \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z
\end{equation}
to write \eqref{eq:fmugrade} in its full form
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\boldsymbol{F}_{\mathrm{VM},\mu} &= - \sum_{\text{cells i},~ \mu \in \Omega_i} \bigg[\frac{1}{2} K_i (A_i - A^0_i) \left[(\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu + 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_i) \times \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z - (\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_i) \times \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z\right]\\
&\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+ \Gamma_i (P_i - P^0_i) \left[\frac{\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}}{|\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}|} + \frac{\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}}{|\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}|}\right]\bigg]\\
&= \sum_{\text{cells i},~ \mu \in \Omega_i} \bigg[\frac{1}{2} K_i (A_i - A^0_i) {\color{blue} \underbrace{(\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu + 1}) \times \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z}_{\text{towards cell interior}}} + \Gamma_i (P_i - P^0_i) \bigg[{\color{purple} \underbrace{\frac{\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu}}{|\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu}|}}_{\text{towards neighbour}}} + {\color{purple} \underbrace{\frac{\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu + 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu}}{|\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu + 1} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu}|}}_{\text{towards neighbour}}}\bigg]\bigg],
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where underbraced vectors are represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:fmu}. It is noteworthy that, with potential \eqref{eq:evm}, the force acting on each cell centre is zero
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{F}_{\mathrm{VM}, i} = - \nabla_i E_{\mathrm{VM}} = - \frac{1}{2} K_i (A_i - A^0_i) \sum_{\mu \in \Omega_i} (\boldsymbol{r}_{\mu} - \boldsymbol{r}_{\mu - 1}) \times \hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z = 0.
\end{equation}

\caption{Vertex representation of a single cell. By convention, cell centres are denoted by latin indices, and cell corners are denotes by greek indices. We denote $\Omega_i$ the ensemble of cell corners $\mu$ of the cell whose centre is $i$. By convention, $\mu + 1$ (respectively $\mu - 1$) denotes the next cell corner of $i$ after $\mu$ in anticlockwise (respectively clockwise) order.}

\section{Half-edge construction}

The edges of the mesh (Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}) divide the entire system in adjacent and non-overlapping \textit{triangles} (or \textit{faces}). We endow all of these triangles with three arrows. These are oriented such that, for an arbitrary vertex (\textit{e.g.}, $\mu$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:he}) and an arbitrary triangle (\textit{e.g.}, $(\mu, \nu, i)$), the cross product of the half-edges pointing toward this vertex in this triangle (\textit{i.e.}, $i \to \mu$) on the one hand and the half-edge pointing out of this vertex in this triangle (\textit{i.e.}, $\mu \to \nu$) on the other hand, has a positive scalar product with $\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z$. We introduce three relations between half-edges, which we exemplify in Fig.~\ref{fig:he} using an arbitrary {\color{yellow} reference half-egde $\mu \to \nu$}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The {\color{purple} \textit{next} half-edge} departs from the vertex pointed at by the reference half-edge (\textit{i.e.}, $\nu$ here) inside the same triangle. ``Next'' is an order-3 bijection, meaning that the next half-edge of the next half-edge of any half-edge is this same half-edge.
    \item The {\color{green} \textit{previous} half-edge} (or {\color{green}\textit{before}}) points towards the vertex from which departs the reference half-edge (\textit{i.e.}, $\mu$ here) inside the same triangle. ``Previous'' is also an order-3 bijection.
    \item The {\color{blue} \textit{pair} half-edge} has inverse depart and arrival vertices with respect to the reference half-edge (\textit{i.e.}, $\nu$ and $\mu$ here) in the adjacent triangle sharing the same edge the reference half-edge belongs to. ``Pair'' is an order-2 bijecton, meaning that the pair half-edge of any pair half-edge is this same half-edge.
\end{enumerate}
We refer to the ensemble of half-edges and vertices as the \textit{half-edge construction}. We propose in Alg.~\ref{alg:check} a way to check its consistency. While this construction contains the same information as the geometric mesh (thus indicating that there is redundancy in this contruction) it enables for faster and in some cases easier computations. We show with Alg.~\ref{alg:neighbours} how to identify all neighbours of any vertex given that each vertex contains the information of (at least) one half-edge leaving the vertex.

\input{src/he}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Half-edge construction in 6 adjacent triangles, highlighting an arbitrary reference half-edge and its associated half-edges.}
\label{fig:he}
\end{figure}

\section{T1 transition}

T1 transitions correspond to changes of neighbours of 4 cells resulting in a modification of the mesh topology, see Fig.~\ref{fig:t1}. First (1) two vertices are merged (\textit{i.e.}, a junction is deleted) creating a \textit{four-vertex}. In principle, if one of the vertices of the deleted junction had initially more than 3 neighbouring cells, there would be more than 4 cells at the merged vertex. While we expect this not to be frequent, the algorithm designed to perform this merge has to take this into account. Then (2) a junction is created (\textit{i.e.}, a vertex is created).

\begin{figure}[!b]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.25*\scale]
\input{src/t1}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Four cells undergoing a T1 transition. (A) Cells at the top and at the bottom are in contact while cells on the left and on the right are disjointed. (B) All four cells are touching, at the centre is a four-vertex. (C) Cells at the top and at the bottom are disjointed while cells on the left and on the right are touching.}
\label{fig:t1}
\end{figure}

It is noteworthy that states (A) and (B) (Fig.~\ref{fig:t1}) are described within the half-edge construction with the same number of half-edges and vertices. Therefore it is possible to implement a direct change from (A) to (B) through a clever relabelling of objects. We propose here to implement the two steps (1) and (2) separately in order to enable also the stabilisation of higher order vertices.

Deleting a junction amounts, in the half-edge construction, to deleting 2 triangles (\textit{i.e.}, sets of 3 half-edges) and one vertex. We represent this operation in Fig.~\ref{fig:merge}, where the junction to delete is $[\mu, \nu]$ ($\mu$ is merged into $\nu$) and the triangles to delete are shaded. Relations between half-edges, as well as the knowledge for each vertex of a half-edge going out of itself, imply that we need to relabel and reaffect half-edges and vertices before deleting anything in order for the construction to remain consistent at the end of the operation (see Alg.~\ref{alg:merge}).
