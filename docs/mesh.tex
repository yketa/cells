\section{Definition of the ``cell'' tissue}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75*\scale]
\input{figs/schematic}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Schematic of a cell (highlighted in pink) in the vertex model.}
\label{fig:schematic}
\end{figure}

A \textit{cell centre} is enclosed by \textit{cell corners} (or \textit{vertices}). These are linked between themselves by \textit{junctions}. We will assume (i) that cells are always convex, (ii) that the mesh remains planar, and (iii) that no edge joins two cell centres. The ensemble of the vertices and the edges that link them constitutes the \textit{geometric mesh}. The specification of the cell centres and the junctions between non-cell-centres defines the \textit{physical mesh}.

\section{Half-edge construction}

\begin{figure}[!b]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8*\scale]
\input{figs/he}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Half-edge construction in 6 adjacent triangles, highlighting an arbitrary reference half-edge and its associated half-edges.}
\label{fig:he}
\end{figure}

The edges of the mesh (Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}) divide the entire system in adjacent and non-overlapping \textit{triangles} (or \textit{faces}). We endow all of these triangles with three arrows. These are oriented such that, for an arbitrary vertex (\textit{e.g.}, $\mu$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:he}) and an arbitrary triangle (\textit{e.g.}, $(\mu, \nu, i)$), the cross product of the half-edges pointing toward this vertex in this triangle (\textit{i.e.}, $i \to \mu$) on the one hand and the half-edge pointing out of this vertex in this triangle (\textit{i.e.}, $\mu \to \nu$) on the other hand, has a positive scalar product with $\hat{\boldsymbol{e}}_z$. We introduce three relations between half-edges, which we exemplify in Fig.~\ref{fig:he} using an arbitrary {\color{yellow} reference half-egde $\mu \to \nu$}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The {\color{purple} \textit{next} half-edge} departs from the vertex pointed at by the reference half-edge (\textit{i.e.}, $\nu$ here) inside the same triangle. ``Next'' is an order-3 bijection, meaning that the next half-edge of the next half-edge of any half-edge is this same half-edge.
    \item The {\color{green} \textit{previous} half-edge} (or {\color{green}\textit{before}}) points towards the vertex from which departs the reference half-edge (\textit{i.e.}, $\mu$ here) inside the same triangle. ``Previous'' is also an order-3 bijection.
    \item The {\color{blue} \textit{pair} half-edge} has inverse depart and arrival vertices with respect to the reference half-edge (\textit{i.e.}, $\nu$ and $\mu$ here) in the adjacent triangle sharing the same edge the reference half-edge belongs to. ``Pair'' is an order-2 bijecton, meaning that the pair half-edge of any pair half-edge is this same half-edge.
\end{enumerate}
We refer to the ensemble of half-edges and vertices as the \textit{half-edge construction}. We propose in Alg.~\ref{alg:check} a way to check its consistency. Compared to the sole definition of vertices and (unoriented) edges, this construction allows for faster and in some cases easier computations. (Such information redundancy comes at the cost of memory usage.) We show with Alg.~\ref{alg:neighbours} how to identify all neighbours of any vertex given that each vertex contains the information of (at least) one half-edge leaving the vertex.

Computationally, we define two elementary classes \textsc{Vertex} and \textsc{HalfEdge} which are collected in a class \textsc{Mesh} (see \href{../mesh.hpp}{\textsc{mesh.hpp}}). Physical properties are described through an attribute \textsc{type} of these elementary classes. This attribute does not interfere with basic operations on the mesh, in this way we separate the geometrical construction from the physical construction.

\section{T1 transition}

T1 transitions correspond to changes of neighbours of 4 cells resulting in a modification of the mesh topology, see Fig.~\ref{fig:t1}. First (1) two vertices are merged (\textit{i.e.}, a junction is deleted) creating a \textit{four-vertex}. In principle, if one of the vertices of the deleted junction had initially more than 3 neighbouring cells, there would be more than 4 cells at the merged vertex. While we expect this not to be frequent, the algorithm designed to perform this merge has to take this into account. Then (2) a junction is created (\textit{i.e.}, a vertex is created).

\begin{figure}[!b]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.25*\scale]
\input{figs/t1}
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Four cells undergoing a T1 transition. (A) Cells at the top and at the bottom are in contact while cells on the left and on the right are disjointed. (B) All four cells are touching, at the centre is a four-vertex. (C) Cells at the top and at the bottom are disjointed while cells on the left and on the right are touching.}
\label{fig:t1}
\end{figure}

It is noteworthy that states (A) and (C) (Fig.~\ref{fig:t1}) are described within the half-edge construction with the same number of half-edges and vertices. Therefore it is possible to implement a direct change from (A) to (C) through a clever relabelling of objects. We propose here to implement the two steps (1) and (2) separately in order to enable also the stabilisation of higher order vertices.

Merging two vertices amounts, in the half-edge construction, to deleting 2 triangles (\textit{i.e.}, 2 sets of 3 half-edges) among which one edge as well as one vertex. We represent this operation in Fig.~\ref{fig:delete}, where the edge to delete is $[\mu, \nu]$ ($\mu$ is merged into $\nu$) and the triangles to delete are shaded. Relations between half-edges, as well as the knowledge for each vertex of a half-edge going out of itself, imply that we need to relabel and reaffect half-edges and vertices before deleting anything in order for the construction to remain consistent at the end of the operation. We describe the procedure in Alg.~\ref{alg:delete}. Note that this procedure does not rely on physical properties of the edges, and is thus purely geometrical in the mesh sense.

\end{algorithm}

Creating an edge involves the same steps as deleting an edge but in reverse order, \textit{i.e.} first create a vertex and 6 half-edges, then relabelling and affecting half-edges and vertices in the system. To identify unequivocally the topology around the new edge in the half-edge construction, it is necessary to specify two distinct half-edges going out of a same vertex. We represent this operation in Fig.~\ref{fig:create}, where vertex $\xi$ is created from vertex $\nu$ and half-edges {\color{green}$\nu \to k$} and {\color{yellow}$\nu \to l$}.

We can now use these algorithms (to delete an edge and create a new one) in order to perform the T1 transition of Fig.~\ref{fig:t1} (see Alg.~\ref{alg:t1}). We discard the stabilisation of four-fold vertices \cite{spencer2017vertex} then, apart from the junction to delete, additional information needed to do this transition are the direction of new junction as well as its length. A possible choice is to create the junction orthogonal to the original junction.

\STATE Move vertices $\nu$ and $\xi$ a distance $\ell$ apart in the direction given by $\alpha$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Open boundaries}

Open boundaries are treated as special vertices for which the orientation condition (Alg.~\ref{alg:check},~l.~\ref{alg:checkori}) is not checked. It is important that the half-edge construction remains well defined so that it is possible to move along the boundary. Finally, when performing T1s (Alg.~\ref{alg:t1}), half-edges towards an open boundary can be considered as half-edges to be split ($\boldsymbol{h}^{\prime}$ and $\boldsymbol{h}^{\prime\prime}$) even though the boundary is a shared neighbour of two vertices, the only important condition is that at least one of these two half-edges has to not go to the boundary.
